        <b>"If your countrymen think that privacy is a crime, so much the worse for your country,"</b>
        says Giovanni to David, of America, in Baldwin's 1956 novel <i>Giovanni's Room</i>. TKTK: more

        Privacy is essential to love.

        Maybe this is because, as implied in a number of Baldwin's works [1], to love somebody is
        to see somebody — demanding the presence of something the lover can see that others cannot.

        But life today seems shaped by a continual diminishing of privacy.

        Communication, once carried out in spaces where we could reasonably assume that no third party was
        listening, is now laid bare and ossified in digital channels at least part of the time.

        Even (TKTK: the rise of entities) that attempt to digitize the act of love itself (TKTK) culture
        of rules about, for example, when it is acceptable to tell somebody you love them, and who it is
        acceptable to say this to.

        But it seems to me you should say this to somebody as soon as it is true.

        Moreover, we are subject not just to surveillance but also to aggregation and evaluation — in short,
        attempts to visibilize us beyond what we may have consented to.

        In this project, I ask: (how) does pervasive surveillance threaten love?

        as well as his essay in <i>Playboy</i>)

        [1] For example, in <i>Giovanni's Room</i> — which Baldwin <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/james-baldwin-on-being-gay-in-america/">calls</a>
        a book about "what happens to you if you're afraid to love anybody" — Giovanni sees David with a clarity that David is unable to reciprocate. And in
        <i>The Fire Next Time</i>, Baldwin writes to his nephew of his brother (his nephew's father): "I don't know if you've known anybody from that far back;
        if you've loved anybody that long...you gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort. Other people cannot see what I see whenever I
        look into your father's face, for behind your father's face as it is today are all those other faces which were his...I know what the world has done
        to my brother and how narrowly he has survived it."
