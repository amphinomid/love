Although "love" does not appear in this piece, it really is about love, and
how privacy is essential to love. (I had the luxury of indulging in James Baldwin
in a quarter-long English class dedicated to the writer, and this idea seemed
to surface again and again. Maybe it's because, as we drew from a number of his
works, to love somebody is to see somebody — demanding the presence of something
the lover can see that others cannot. For example, in _Giovanni's Room_, which
Baldwin calls a novel about "what happens to you if you're afraid to love anybody"
in a 1984 Village Voice interview, Giovanni sees David with a clarity David is
unable to reciprocate. He sees that David will leave; that David cannot really go
home; that David is afraid to love him; that David does not really love Hella
either.)

But the present is shaped by a continual diminishing of privacy. Communication
is now laid bare and ossified in digital channels at least part of the time.
Moves to digitize love itself (especially romantic love, through inventions like
dating apps) reduce love from a liberating social responsibility to a highly
choreographed and hypervisible performance defined by rules (e.g., rules about
when it is acceptable to tell somebody you love them, as if this should not be
said as soon as it is true). Moreover, we are subject not just to the collection
of private data but also to its aggregation and evaluation: i.e., attempts to
visibilize us, often beyond what we have consented to. This reality seems
antithetical to ones Baldwin may have envisioned as he repeated expressed the
importance of privacy to love.

Baldwin's full quote from "Freaks and the American Ideal of Manhood," the essay
referenced in the piece, is as follows: "It is virtually impossible to trust one's
human value without the collaboration or corroboration of that eye — which is to
say that no one can live without it. One can, of course, instruct that eye as to
what to see, but this effort, which is nothing less than ruthless intimidation, is
wounding and exhausting: While it can keep humiliation at bay, it confirms the fact
that humiliation is the central danger of one's life. And since one cannot risk love
without risking humiliation, love becomes impossible." This eye includes entities
which surveil. We behave differently when we know we are being watched, and when we
say we "have nothing to hide," we make humiliation the "central danger" and make
love difficult. (Baldwin makes even more direct a statement in the Village Voice
interview, holding close his experiences with love and sexuality, making clear they
are intensely private matters.)

There are four lines of text, each with 13 words. The first line is a quote from
Baldwin's essay. The second is a citation. The third and fourth are responses I
wrote in the English class I mentioned earlier, that the way we think about privacy
(and our growing lack of it) may sound defiant but really reflects a deep-seated
fear, and furthermore threatens our freedom by convincing us this fear is more
important. Each character's bit was computed by xor'ing it with its index in the
string (xor because of its prominence in cryptographic work). Representing the
digitization and surveillance of love, they flicker on and off, both erasing and
obscuring. It's a negative omen (a warning of how digital surveillance threatens
love) as well as a positive one (a declaration that there remain deep personal
truths such surveillance cannot capture — as we find ways to practice love that are
as present, private and offline as possible, as we find ways to protect ourselves
and our loved ones fiercely). It's luck, both good and bad.
