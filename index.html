        <b>"If your countrymen think that privacy is a crime, so much the worse for your country,"</b>
        says Giovanni to David, of America, in Baldwin's 1956 novel <i>Giovanni's Room</i>. TKTK: more.

        <br><br>

        Privacy is essential to love.

        Maybe this is because, as implied in a number of Baldwin's works [1], to love somebody is to see
        somebody — demanding the presence of something the lover can see that others cannot.

        But the present is shaped by a continual diminishing of privacy.

        Communication, once done mostly in spaces in which we could reasonably assume no third party was
        watching, is now laid bare and ossified in digital channels at least part of the time.

        The move to digitize love itself (in particular, romantic love) reduces love from a liberating act
        of social responsibility to a highly choreographed and hypervisible performance defined by rules about,
        e.g., when it is acceptable to tell somebody you love them; as if this should not be said as
        soon as it is true.

        <br><br>

        Moreover, we are subject not just to surveillance but also to aggregation and evaluation — in short,
        attempts to visibilize us beyond what we may have consented to.

        In this project, I ask: (how) does pervasive surveillance threaten love?

        (TKTK: but I don't yet know where — Baldwin's <i>Village Voice</i> interview about the privacy of queerness,
        as well as his essay in <i>Playboy</i>)

        <br><br>

        <i>Process</i>
        <br>
        The background image, depicting a queer romantic relationship, is gradually encoded into bits representing
        each pixel's RGB values. The bits both erase and obscure, a simultaneous warning (of how digital surveillance
        complicates love) and expression of optimism (there are deep personal truths that such surveillance cannot
        capture). I wanted the background to evoke <i>GR</i> and to be as vivid and visually arresting as the images
        of that novel, but could not find one directly referencing the novel that made sense. I chose a still from
        <i>Happy Together</i> because I think the work takes on a similar valence as <i>GR</i>, telling the story of
        a difficult queer romance that plays out across the globe from home.

        <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">
        [1] For example, in <i>GR</i> — which Baldwin <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/james-baldwin-on-being-gay-in-america/">calls</a>
        a novel about "what happens to you if you're afraid to love anybody" — Giovanni, who loves David, sees him with a clarity that he is unable to
        reciprocate. And in <i>The Fire Next Time</i>, Baldwin writes to his nephew of his brother (his nephew's father): "I don't know if you've known
        anybody from that far back; if you've loved anybody that long...you gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort. Other people cannot
        see what I see whenever I look into your father's face, for behind your father's face as it is today are all those other faces which were his...I
        know what the world has done to my brother and how narrowly he has survived it."
